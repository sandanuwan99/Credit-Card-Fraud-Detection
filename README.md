Introduction
Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the finance industry. Fraudulent transactions can cause significant financial losses and compromise the security of financial systems. This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions and minimize financial losses.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions over a certain period. The data has been preprocessed to protect user privacy and includes the following features:

Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1 to V28: Principal components obtained using PCA to anonymize the data.
Amount: Transaction amount.
Class: Label where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a legitimate transaction.
Installation
To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn

Usage
Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git

Navigate to the repository directory:
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook "Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb"

Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the models.
Features
Data loading and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Data visualization
Handling class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE
Building machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
Model evaluation using various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)


Models and Evaluation
The notebook includes the implementation of several machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions. The models are evaluated using metrics such as:

Confusion Matrix
Precision-Recall Curve
ROC Curve and AUC
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
Results
The results section in the notebook provides a detailed analysis of the model performances. The best-performing model is highlighted, along with its evaluation metrics.
